## Development

### Getting Started

This repository has at least one submodule. Therefore you'll need to do a recursive clone:

```

If you've already cloned but not recursively, you can initialize any submodules with

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Start electron app in developer mode:
    ```bash
